Project Overview
Welcome to our project! We've set up some essential development practices and tools to ensure code quality, consistency, and a seamless development workflow. Here's what you need to know:

Code Formatting and Style
Prettier on Commit: We've configured our project to automatically format code using Prettier whenever changes are committed. This keeps our codebase consistently clean and easy to read.

ESLint on Commit:
ESLint is set to run on every commit, ensuring that our JavaScript code adheres to coding standards and best practices.

Version Control
Protected Default Branch: Our default branch is protected, meaning that it's a safe and stable representation of our codebase.

Branching Conventions:
We follow specific branching conventions to keep our development process organized and efficient. This ensures that work is properly segmented and can be easily merged into the default branch when it's ready.

Continuous Integration and Deployment
Automatic Building and Deployment: We've set up a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automatically build and deploy the project when changes are merged into the default branch. Our code is automatically tested, and updates are seamlessly deployed to our web hosting platform.
